# CloudyCar

### The Goal 
Cloudy Car is an Uber-like application that enables users to become drivers and riders. Cloudy Car was built for my Software Development class as a group project. The professor outlined User Stories for us to turn into a functionality spec.

### The Approach
As the designer and front end developer of the app, I made it my mission to apply as many design patterns and techniques that I had learned to the app. They are all outlined in the following [design overview](https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/cloudy-car-db1f84bb1306).

### The Result 
Cloudy Car was an excellent app, but it had no real use. The professor was inspired by Uber, but created some requirements that would not make sense for any user to use. There was no value being added.
